**My Little Diary** is a personal artistic experiment and portfolio website created and designed by Eva Gierczynska.

It started as a playful “confidential diary” during the pandemic — a mix between a creative outlet and a professional call for collaboration. The goal was simple: connect with people, find interesting projects, and open doors to work in graphic design and digital art.

## About the project
This website was:

- Designed and built by me  
- Coded using basic HTML and CSS  
- Created as a personal branding experiment  
- Developed as both a portfolio and a narrative experience  

The tone intentionally blends irony, vulnerability, and self-promotion. It reflects a specific moment: living in Paris during the pandemic, working in the cultural sector, and looking for creative opportunities.

## Purpose
This project explores:

- Personal branding through storytelling  
- Blurring the line between diary and portfolio  
- Using humor and honesty as a professional strategy  
- Designing a digital space that feels intimate but intentional
