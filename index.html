        <h2>Who is Eva G?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hi, I'm Eva Gierczynska, I'm Polish and have been living in France for 3 years now. I got my Master's Degree in Cultural management a couple of months ago, but because of pandemic I obviously can't find a job. I know Adobe, especially InDesign and Illustrator, but also Canva and the basics of HTML and CSS, which you can see by looking at this website that I did myself. Currently, I'm writing articles for <a href="https://contentyze.com/index.html" target="_blank">contentyze.com</a>. I'm smart and would like to start working with graphic design and digital art. If you would like to do a project together or you have a job offer that I may find interesting, hit me up. If you would like to see what I've already done, <a href="http://evagierczynska.myportfolio.com" target="_blank">click here to see my portfolio.</a><br><b>My Little Diary</b> is a project invented and realised entirely by me and almost everything you can see here has been done by me. It's a kind of an artistic experiment that I hope will bring its expected results. </p>

          <h3>What's the point?</h3>
          <p>The point is that living in Paris during the pandemic, I'm awfully bored, and what's even worse, I don't have a job. I work in the cultural sector and it's been dead for quite some time now. This website is my way of either finding people to hang out with, or finally finding a job. </p>

          <h3>Can you participate?</h3>
          <p>You can if you want to. Depending on what role you want to potentially play in my life, just leave your email address or your instagram in the right place and I will respond! If you feel you could be my friend, <strong>click below</strong> or find me @evvaave</p>
